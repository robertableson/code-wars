    if(typeof num === 'number')
        sum = sum + num;
    });

    return typeof sum === 'number' ? sum : 0;
}
```


## Opposites Attract

### Instructions
Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

### Submitted solution
```JavaScript
function lovefunc(flower1, flower2){
    // Notes
    // - If given 2 numbers, f1 and f2, if one of them 
    //   is odd AND one of them is even, return true

## Jaden Casing Strings

### Instructions
Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.

Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.

### Submitted solution
```JavaScript
String.prototype.toJadenCase = function () {
  // Make sentence lowercase
  // Uppercase the first letter of each word
  
  const sentence = this;  
  const sentenceWordsArray = sentence.toLowerCase().split(' ');
  let formattedSentence = '';
  
  formattedSentence = sentenceWordsArray.map((word) => {
    return word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1);
  }).join(' ');
  
  return formattedSentence;
};
```


## Sum of the first nth term of Series

### Instructions
Your task is to write a function which returns the sum of following series upto nth term(parameter).

Series: 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 + 1/16 +...

Rules:
You need to round the answer to 2 decimal places and return it as String.

If the given value is 0 then it should return 0.00

You will only be given Natural Numbers as arguments.

### Submitted solution
```JavaScript
function SeriesSum(n){
  let result = 0;
  let denominatorDiff = 1;
  
  for(let i = 0; i < n; i++){
    if(i === 0){
      result = 1;
    }else{
      denominatorDiff += 3;
      result = result + (1 / denominatorDiff);
    }
  }
  
  return result.toFixed(2);
};
```


## Number of People in the Bus

### Instructions
There is a bus moving in the city, and it takes and drop some people in each bus stop.

You are provided with a list (or array) of integer pairs. Elements of each pair represent number of people get into bus (The first item) and number of people get off the bus (The second item) in a bus stop.

Your task is to return number of people who are still in the bus after the last bus station (after the last array). Even though it is the last bus stop, the bus is not empty and some people are still in the bus, and they are probably sleeping there :D

Take a look on the test cases.

Please keep in mind that the test cases ensure that the number of people in the bus is always >= 0. So the return integer can't be negative.

The second value in the first integer array is 0, since the bus is empty in the first bus stop.

### Submitted solution
```JavaScript
var number = function(busStops){
  let totalPeople = 0;
  
  busStops.map((arrOnOff) => {
    totalPeople = totalPeople + arrOnOff[0] - arrOnOff[1]; 
  });
  
  return totalPeople;
}
```

### Alternative solution
```JavaScript
const number = (busStops) => busStops.reduce((rem, [on, off]) => rem + on - off, 0);
```


## Is this a triangle?

### Instructions
Implement a function that accepts 3 integer values a, b, c. The function should return true if a triangle can be built with the sides of given length and false in any other case.

(In this case, all triangles must have surface greater than 0 to be accepted).

### Submitted solution
```JavaScript
function isTriangle(a,b,c){
  // Notes
  // To know if it is a triangle, we can use the use the triangle inequality theorem,
  // which states that the sum of 2 sides should always be greater than the 3rd
  
  return a + b > c && b + c > a && a + c > b;
}
```


## You Can't Code Under Pressure #1

### Instructions

```JavaScript
function doubleInteger(i) {
  return i * 2;
}
```


## The highest profit wins!

### Instructions
Ben has a very simple idea to make some profit: he buys something and sells it again. Of course, this wouldn't give him any profit at all if he was simply to buy and sell it at the same price. Instead, he's going to buy it for the lowest possible price and sell it at the highest.

Task
Write a function that returns both the minimum and maximum number of the given list/array.

Examples (Input --> Output)
[1,2,3,4,5] --> [1,5]
[2334454,5] --> [5,2334454]
[1]         --> [1,1]
Remarks
All arrays or lists will always have at least one element, so you don't need to check the length. Also, your function will always get an array or a list, you don't have to check for null, undefined or similar.

### Submitted solution
```JavaScript
function minMax(arr){
  let minMax = [Math.min(...arr), Math.max(...arr)];
  
  return minMax;
}
```


## Grasshopper - Summation

### Instructions
Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

For example:

summation(2) -> 3
1 + 2

summation(8) -> 36
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8

### Submitted solution
```JavaScript
var summation = function (num) {
  let total = 0;
  
  for(let i = 1; i <= num; i++){
    total += i;
  }
  
  return total;
}
```

### Alternative solution
```JavaScript
const summation = n => n * (n + 1) / 2;
```


## Printer Errors

### Instructions
In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.

The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time color a...

Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.

You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.

Examples:
s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"
printer_error(s) => "0/14"

s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"
printer_error(s) => "8/22"

### Submitted solution
```JavaScript
function printerError(s) {
  // Notes
  // ascii code of a = 97, m = 109
  // 1. Loop over chars and make sure each char is between ascii numbers
  // 2. If not, count for numerator
  
  let numerator = 0;
  
  for(let i = 0; i < s.length; i++){
    s[i].charCodeAt(0) < 97 || s[i].charCodeAt(0) > 109 ? numerator++ : null;
  }
    
    return `${numerator}/${s.length}`  
}
```


## Sum without highest and lowest number

### Instructions
Sum all the numbers of a given array ( cq. list ), except the highest and the lowest element ( by value, not by index! ).

The highest or lowest element respectively is a single element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value.

Mind the input validation.

Example
{ 6, 2, 1, 8, 10 } => 16
{ 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 } => 6
Input validation
If an empty value ( null, None, Nothing etc. ) is given instead of an array, or the given array is an empty list or a list with only 1 element, return 0.

### Submitted solution
```JavaScript
function sumArray(array) {
  // Notes
  // - Return sum - min - max
  // - Validate input
  
  // Input validation: exists, is array and is array with >2 things in it
  if(!array || !Array.isArray(array) || 
     (Array.isArray(array) && array.length <= 1)){ 
    return 0;
  }
  
  let min = array[0];
  let max = min;
  let total = 0;
  
  for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++){    
    if(array[i] < min) min = array[i];
    if(array[i] > max) max = array[i];
    
    total += array[i];
  }
  
  return total - min - max;
}
```

### Alternative solution
```JavaScript
sumArray = a => a ? a.sort((x, y) => x - y).slice(1, -1).reduce((s, e) => s + e, 0) : 0
```


## Binary Addition

### Instructions
Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition.

    p2 === 'paper' && p1 === 'rock' ||
     p2 === 'scissors' && p1 === 'paper'){
    msg = 'Player 2 won!';
  }
  
  return msg;
};
```

### Alternative solution

## Detect Pangram

### Instructions
A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.

### Submitted solution
```JavaScript
function isPangram(string){

Note: Numbers can be from 1 to 9. So 1 will be the first word (not 0).

If the input string is empty, return an empty string. The words in the input String will only contain valid consecutive numbers.

### Submitted solution
```JavaScript
function order(words) {
  const wordsArr = words.split(' ');
  let wordsInOrder = [];
  let numInWord = 0;
  
  wordsArr.forEach( ( word ) => {
    numInWord = parseInt( word.replace(/\D/g,'') ); // Removes all non-numeric chars

}

// returns the number of items within the entire collection
PaginationHelper.prototype.itemCount = function() {
  return this.collection.length;
}

// returns the number of pages
PaginationHelper.prototype.pageCount = function() {
  return Math.ceil( this.collection.length / this.itemsPerPage );
}

// returns the number of items on the current page. page_index is zero based.
// this method should return -1 for pageIndex values that are out of range
PaginationHelper.prototype.pageItemCount = function(pageIndex) {
  return pageIndex < this.pageCount() 
    ? Math.min(this.itemsPerPage, this.collection.length - pageIndex * this.itemsPerPage)
    : -1;
}

// determines what page an item is on. Zero based indexes
// this method should return -1 for itemIndex values that are out of range
PaginationHelper.prototype.pageIndex = function(itemIndex) {

    ? Math.floor(itemIndex / this.itemsPerPage)
    : -1;
}
```


## Duplicate Encoder
